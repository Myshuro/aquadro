A small project for a friend that has apartments that can be rented on the seaside in Italy
https://aquadro.netlify.app/
HTML CSS Bootstrap JavaScript
The project is not complete !!!
It is hosted on netlify and it is connected to github so that any changes that are committed from my local repository to github are also visible on the website.
There is also a small back-end part that is hosted on render.com - unfortunately it goes to sleep if not used and it takes a about 60 seconds to come back when it receives a request.
Also working on a small data-base on supabase for this project (very early stages so nothing to share yet)
